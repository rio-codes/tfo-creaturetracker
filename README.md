## TFO.creaturetracker 
is a next.js site to organize your collection, predict breeding results and reach your research goals for the game [The Final Outpost](https://finaloutpost.net), deployed on Vercel at https://tfo.creaturetracker.net. You can import your creatures into a collection, match them into breeding pairs, make goals based on possible outcomes from those breeding pairs, or make goals from scratch/bring them in from TFO by copying over traits. You can track breedings and progeny to see how you're doing at meeting your goals, and if you like, as an inbreeding indicator. Here are some screenshots from different parts of the site:

## Features
### The Collection pulls your creatures from the TFO API and allows you to integrate them with your other data.

### Your Research Goals can be created from scratch or by checking outcomes of a breeding pair and can be set in phenotype mode or genotype mode (are you aiming for the "look" or the "exact genes").

### Each Research Goal has a tracker that shows breeding pairs you've assigned to it, their "match score" and if it's possible to get the goal in one generation, as well as any progeny that have been assigned to the goal and how close they are to reaching it.
