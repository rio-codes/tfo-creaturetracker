# tfo-creaturetracker
TFO.creaturetracker is a next.js site to organize your collection, predict breeding results and reach your research goals, deployed on Vercel at https://tfo.creaturetracker.net.

## Mockups
Here are some screenshots from Figma of mockups I've made while planning out this site.
<h4>This will be the Collection page, where you can filter and browse through your TFO creatures to add to breeding pairs.</h4>

<h4>"Add to Breeding Pair" will bring up a dialog like this. Here you will be able to select a creature to breed and the research goal to associate with that pair.</h4>

<h4>Here is a mock-up of the Research Goal page, where you will be able to manage your research goals for your creatures. </h4>

<h4>Below is a proposed page for a single Research Goal, showing the probabilities of each trait in any given hybrid cross. You will also be able to view breeding pairs associated with the goal, log when you breed them, and add new pairs.</h4>

<h4>This is a possible Breeding Pairs browser, where you can search and filter your breeding pairs and view statistics on their suitability for your goal creature as well as your logged breedings.</h4>
